# LayoutLM Fine-Tuning and Usage Repository

This repository contains scripts for fine-tuning the LayoutLM model (Microsoft/layoutlm-base-uncased) using the LayoutLMv2 algorithm. The repository is organized into four main folders:

1. **creation_of_layout_lm_data**
    - Contains scripts for preprocessing data to create a dataset suitable for fine-tuning the LayoutLM model.
    - Ensure to follow the guidelines in the folder to structure and format your training data.

2. **data_created (by creation_scripts)**
    - The processed data generated by the scripts in the `creation_of_layout_lm_data` folder should be placed here.
    - This folder serves as the input data for the fine-tuning process.

3. **layout_training_on_local**
    - Includes scripts and configuration files for fine-tuning the LayoutLM model locally.
    - Before using these scripts, make sure you have the required dependencies installed and the data in the `data_created` folder.

4. **use_layout_lm_model**
    - Contains scripts for using the fine-tuned LayoutLM model for inference on new data.
    - Ensure to follow the provided guidelines to integrate the model into your workflow.

## Fine-Tuning Process

1. **Data Preparation**
    - Execute scripts in the `creation_of_layout_lm_data` folder to preprocess and structure your data.

2. **Data Placement**
    - Move the processed data to the `data_created` folder.

3. **Fine-Tuning**
    - Run scripts in the `layout_training_on_local` folder to fine-tune the LayoutLM model.
    - Adjust hyperparameters and configurations as needed.

4. **Inference**
    - Use scripts in the `use_layout_lm_model` folder for making predictions on new data.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed before running any scripts. You can find a list of dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Notes

- Make sure to adhere to licensing agreements and usage policies associated with the base model (Microsoft/layoutlm-base-uncased).
- Provide appropriate credit to the authors of the base model and algorithm (LayoutLMv2) in your project documentation.

Feel free to customize this README.md file further based on your specific project details and requirements.
